### 100 Lockers
There are 100 closed lockers in a hallway. A man begins by opening all 100 lockers.
<br>Next, he closes every second locker. Then, on his third pass, he toggles every third locker (closes it if it is open or opens it if it is closed).
<br>This process continues for 100 passes, such that on each pass 'i', the man toggles every 'i'th locker.
<br>
<br>After his 100th pass in the hallway, in which he toggles only locker #100, how many lockers are open?
