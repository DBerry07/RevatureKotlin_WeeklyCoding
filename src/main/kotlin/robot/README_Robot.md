# Revature Weekly Coding Challenge: 25 April 2022
## Robot in a Grid
Revature Bench weekly coding exercise for 25 April, 2022.

### Exercise Outline
Imagine a robot sitting on 
the upper left corner of grid with r rows and c 
columns. 
<br>The robot can only move in two directions, 
right and down, but certain cells are "off limits" 
such that the robot cannot step on them. 
<br><br>Design an 
algorithm to find a path for the robot from the top 
left to the bottom right.
